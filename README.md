# Code Chrysalis Algorithms Meetup!

Let's make our heads hurt together :)

## About the Algos Meetup

[Our meetup](https://www.meetup.com/codechrysalis) is welcome to algorithm lovers of **all languages AND levels**. We want this to be a space where people can work through fun algos together and learn from each other.

* Almost all the algorithm questions are language agnostic. This means that they can be solved by any language you prefer.
* Feel free to work alone, in a pair, or on a team! Make a friend!
* Discussing with others is highly encouraged! Make a friend!
* When presenting your solution in front of people, please use pseudo-code language (e.g. "I loop through the array and choose only the items that match the target.").
* Feel free to contribute! Put your algos into the `algorithm-drafts` folder.

## Meetup Rules

* **Be kind and considerate** to everyone's questions and answers
* **Be encouraging, helpful, and patient** to those who have less knowledge/experience than you
* **Ask questions and listen** to those who have more knowledge/experience than you
* There are many ways of solving these algorithms, so please **be open** to other possibilities

## Rating System

The higher the number, the harder the algorithm.

Algorithms are rated from 1 to 5.

Roughly speaking...

* 1 = Beginners
* 2 = Advanced Beginners
* 3 = Medium
* 4 = Advanced Medium, CS knowledge probably helps
* 5 = Headache, CS knowledge will definitely help
